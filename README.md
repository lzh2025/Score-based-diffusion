# Score-based-diffusion
## Background
The notebook is based on Yang Song's articles:  
1.[Generative Modeling by Estimating Gradients of the Data Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05600)  
2.[Score-Based Generative Modeling through Stochastic Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13456)  

This project refers to the code of this URL（https://colab.research.google.com/drive/120kYYBOVa1i0TD85RjlEkFjaWDxSFUx3?usp=sharing#scrollTo=yC49nk6ZXqOS） and makes a more detailed introduction to the mathematical principles as well as code comments, suitable for beginners to learn.
## Install
The project is built on pytorch 1.13.0, you can go to [official website](https://pytorch.org/) to install.
## Usage
Just run SDE score-based.ipynb and the training as well as the generation steps are done.
